1. Change Product Name
We’ll update the form and database pages for the product purchase requests to reflect the new name.

2. Add Subtitle
We’ll add subtitles to each of the cards on the home page and to the forms to give users a better understanding of each service.

3. Feedback Improvements
We'll update the feedback form to include fields for the user’s name, the service they hope to provide (HR, Finance, IT), and an option to upload attachments or send URLs.

4. Auto-Count Days in HR Field
We'll add a function to the HR form to automatically calculate the number of days requested based on the start and end dates chosen in the calendar.

Let’s implement these changes step by step!

Changing "Service Type" to "Your Department."
Adding a new field for the type of holiday with options for "Work Day Off," "Go to Work Event," "Conference," "Deployment," "Maternity," or "Personal Staff."
